# PPGEEC2318-Machine Learning Course Repository

### Student: Nathan Souza de Oliveira

This repository is part of my coursework for the Machine Learning course in my post-graduation program in Computer Engineering, with an emphasis on Intelligence Process of Information, at UFRN(Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte). 

Here, you will find various tasks and assignments related to the course, each organized within its respective branch.

## Repository Organization

The repository is structured with separate branches for each task and assignment from the Machine Learning course. This organization helps in maintaining a clean and structured repository, where each branch is dedicated to a specific piece of coursework.

### Current Branches
- `main`: This branch includes the general course information and links to other specific task branches.
- `task_1`: [Task 1 - Video Summaries of Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://github.com/nathansouz4/MACHINE-LEARNING/tree/task_1)

## Task 1: Video Summaries

In the `task_1` branch, you will find a series of five video summaries. Each video is a concise 5-minute explanation covering the key points of the first five chapters of the book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen. 

Additionally, this branch includes markdown files that provide a written summary of the key concepts and lessons learned from each chapter.
