# Chapter 2: Framing the Problem

## Key Points

- **Problem Definition**: Clearly defining the problem is fundamental. Ambiguity leads to misaligned metrics and poor outcomes.
- **Metrics and Objectives**: Choose evaluation metrics that align with real-world objectives. Different metrics may optimize for conflicting outcomes, so trade-offs must be understood.
- **End-to-End Perspective**: Frame the problem with end-users in mind. Consider the entire workflow and how ML fits into the business process.
- **Benchmarking**: Establish benchmarks using baselines, which help in understanding improvements and setting realistic expectations.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Problem framing may evolve as insights are gained during development and testing phases.
