# Chapter 3: Data Management for ML Systems

## Key Points

- **Data Quality**: High-quality data is the backbone of effective ML systems. Issues such as noise, missing data, and outliers need addressing.
- **Data Pipelines**: Build robust pipelines for consistent data collection, preprocessing, and transformation.
- **Data Versioning**: Keep track of different versions of datasets to ensure reproducibility and effective collaboration.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identify and create relevant features that contribute meaningfully to the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Data Validation**: Implement checks to catch data drift and prevent training-serving skew, ensuring data consistency throughout the system lifecycle.
