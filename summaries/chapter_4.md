# Chapter 4: Building and Scaling ML Models

## Key Points

- **Model Complexity**: Balance complexity and performance; overly complex models may be hard to deploy and maintain.
- **Scalability**: Design for scale from the beginning. Evaluate whether the chosen model architecture supports scalability needs (horizontal and vertical scaling).
- **Distributed Training**: Use distributed systems and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train models on large datasets efficiently.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automate tuning processes with tools like grid search, random search, or advanced optimization algorithms to enhance model performance.
- **Resource Management**: Optimize resource allocation, considering computation costs and energy efficiency.
