# Chapter 5: Model Deployment and Monitoring

## Key Points

- **Deployment Strategies**: Employ different deployment techniques like canary releases and A/B testing to minimize risks and collect performance data.
- **Real-Time vs. Batch**: Understand the difference between real-time serving systems and batch processing, selecting the approach that best suits the use case.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement robust monitoring to track model performance post-deployment and capture deviations from expected behavior.
- **Retraining and Updates**: Regularly retrain models to handle concept drift and changing data distributions, automating the retraining pipeline where possible.
- **Alerts and Incident Response**: Establish alerts for anomalies and create incident response plans to handle model failures or unexpected results efficiently.
